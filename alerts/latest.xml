    <summary>An unstable and moist atmosphere brings a risk of thunderstorms to parts of the North Island today. For eastern parts of Coromandel Peninsula and Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Taupo, and northern Gisborne/Tairawhiti, there is also a moderate risk of localised downpours with rainfall rates of 25 to 40 mm/h until late evening. Note, Severe Weather Warnings and Watches for widespread heavy rain are also in force for some of these regions.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
