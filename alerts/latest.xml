    <summary>Thunderstorms are possible about parts of Hawke's Bay this afternoon. For Cape Kidnappers area and inland Hawke's Bay from Napier southwards there is a risk of SEVERE thunderstorms or localised downpours during the afternoon bringing rain with intensities of 25 to 35 mm per hour. Conditions should ease early evening.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
