    <summary>Update at 6:30pm Wednesday (New Years Eve) - Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains in force for southern Northland and Auckland until 10pm this evening, lifted from all other areas. 
The risk of severe thunderstorms producing localised downpours of 25-40 mm/h continues about southern Northland (south of Whangarei) and the Auckland region until 10pm this evening (Wednesday, New Years Eve).
Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain. 
The thunderstorm activity is expected to die away late evening.
