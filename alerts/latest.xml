    <summary>A warm moist air-mass and daytime heating are likely to generate heavy showers and thunderstorms over inland parts the upper North Island this afternoon and evening. For inland parts of Northland and Auckland north of about Albany, there is a moderate risk of SEVERE
thunderstorms with localised downpours of 25 to 40 mm/h between 3 and 9pm today. Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
