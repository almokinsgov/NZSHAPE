    <summary>Afternoon and early evening thunderstorms are expected about eastern parts of Bay of Plenty and northern Gisborne/Tairawhiti. Some of these thunderstorms may become SEVERE east of Opotiki, producing downpours of 25 to 40 mm per hour.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 

Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
