    <summary>At 09:45 pm, MetService weather radar detected severe thunderstorms near ASHLEY FOREST and LEES VALLEY.

These severe thunderstorms are moving towards the northeast, and are expected to lie near WEKA PASS, WAIKARI and HAWARDEN at 10:45 pm.

These thunderstorms are expected to be accompanied by large hail and frequent lightning.

Impact:

Large hail can cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vines, glasshouses and vehicles, and make driving conditions hazardous.

Frequent lightning is dangerous to people and livestock, especially those exposed outdoors or on the water, and can cause power surges and damage to electrical equipment.</summary>
