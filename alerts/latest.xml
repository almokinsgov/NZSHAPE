    <summary>Amended at 7.05am

Rain with heavy falls is expected to affect the Bay of Plenty and the far north of Gisborne during Wednesday morning, and there is a moderate risk of downpours with rainfall intensities 25 to 40 mm/h for those areas.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
