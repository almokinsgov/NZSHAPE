    <summary>A cold and unstable air-mass affects the South Island. For much of Fiordland, Southland, Otago, and Canterbury from about Christchurch southwards, there is a moderate risk of thunderstorms this afternoon and evening. There is also a moderate risk that some of these storms may become SEVERE until 9pm today (Saturday), which could produce localised downpours of 25 to 40 mm/h and/or hail larger than 20 mm.
Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain. 
Large hail can cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vines, glasshouses and vehicles, as well as make driving conditions hazardous. 
Should severe weather approach or if you feel threatened, take shelter immediately.
