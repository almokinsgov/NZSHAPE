    <summary>Rain with heavy falls is expected to affect the Bay of Plenty today and Wednesday morning. Downpours of 25 to 40 mm/h are also expected within the broad area of heavy rain overnight Tuesday and early Wednesday morning, especially east of Kawerau.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.

    <summary>A heavy rain band is expected to move eastwards across the North Island during today. There is mostly a low risk of thunderstorms affecting Northland from about Whangarei southwards, Auckland and Coromandel Peninsula this evening. There is a moderate risk that convection embedded in the rain band will produce localised downpours with rain rates of 25 to 40 mm/h.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
