    <summary>Slow-moving thunderstorms are expected about central parts of the North Island this afternoon and evening. For the southeast of Waikato, inland parts of Bay of Plenty, Gisborne and Hawke's Bay, plus eastern parts of Taupo and Taihape, some of these thunderstorms may become severe, producing localised downpours with rainfall rates of 25 to 40 mm/h. 

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
