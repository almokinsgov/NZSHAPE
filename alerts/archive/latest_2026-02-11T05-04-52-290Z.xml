    <summary>Slow-moving thunderstorms are expected about central parts of the North Island this afternoon and evening. For the southeast of Waikato, inland parts of Bay of Plenty, Gisborne and Hawke's Bay, plus eastern parts of Taupo and Taihape, some of these thunderstorms may become severe, producing localised downpours with rainfall rates of 25 to 40 mm/h. 

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.

    <summary>At 05:15 pm, MetService weather radar detected severe thunderstorms near ROTORUA, WAIOTAPU, WAIKITE VALLEY and LAKE TARAWERA.

These severe thunderstorms are moving towards the northwest, and are expected to lie near ROTORUA, NGONGOTAHA and WAIREKA at 05:45 pm and near ROTORUA, MAMAKU, NGONGOTAHA and THE HILLS AND RANGES EAST OF TOKOROA at 06:15 pm.

These thunderstorms are expected to be accompanied by torrential rain, hail and frequent lightning.

Impact:

Torrential rain can cause surface and/or flash flooding about streams, gullies and urban areas, and make driving conditions extremely hazardous.

Hail can cause damage to crops, orchards and vines and may make driving conditions hazardous.

Frequent lightning is dangerous to people and livestock, especially those exposed outdoors or on the water, and can cause power surges and damage to electrical equipment.</summary>
