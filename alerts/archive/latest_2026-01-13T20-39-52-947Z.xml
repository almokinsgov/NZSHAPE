    <summary>A moist unstable northwesterly flow is expected to bring thunderstorms to Taranaki during Thursday. From around 2am there is a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms bringing localised rainfall intensities of 25 to 40 mm/h. 

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
