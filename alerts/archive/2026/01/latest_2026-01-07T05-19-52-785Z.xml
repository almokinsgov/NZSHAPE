    <summary>Afternoon and evening thunderstorms are expected in inland parts of Bay of Plenty (from Rotorua eastwards), eastern Taupo, inland Gisborne/Tairawhiti and the Wairoa District. These thunderstorms may become severe, producing localised downpours with rainfall rates of 25 to 40 mm per hour.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
