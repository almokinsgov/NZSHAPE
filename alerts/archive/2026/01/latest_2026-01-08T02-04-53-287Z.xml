These severe thunderstorms are moving towards the south, and are expected to lie near THE RAUKUMARA RANGE at 03:07 pm and near THE RAUKUMARA RANGE at 03:37 pm.

These thunderstorms are expected to be accompanied by torrential rain, hail and frequent lightning.

Impact:

Torrential rain can cause surface and/or flash flooding about streams, gullies and urban areas, and make driving conditions extremely hazardous.

Hail can cause damage to crops, orchards and vines and may make driving conditions hazardous.

Frequent lightning is dangerous to people and livestock, especially those exposed outdoors or on the water, and can cause power surges and damage to electrical equipment.</summary>
