    <summary>Unstable conditions are expected to generate intense showers this afternoon and into the evening. These showers may be accompanied by downpours and damaging hail.

Large hail can cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vines, glasshouses and vehicles, as well as make driving conditions hazardous. 
Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips.
