    <summary>Scattered showers and thunderstorms are forecast for inland and northern parts of Canterbury this afternoon and early evening, also possibly affecting Christchurch City. There is a moderate risk of a few of these thunderstorms becoming SEVERE, producing localised downpours of 25 to 40 mm/h or large hail in excess of 2 cm in diameter. Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. Large hail can cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vines, glasshouses and vehicles, as well as make driving conditions hazardous. 

Expect thunderstorm activity to ease tonight.
