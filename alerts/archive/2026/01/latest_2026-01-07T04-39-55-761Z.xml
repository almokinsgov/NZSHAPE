    <summary>Afternoon and evening thunderstorms are expected in inland parts of Bay of Plenty (from Rotorua eastwards), eastern Taupo, inland Gisborne/Tairawhiti and the Wairoa District. These thunderstorms may become severe, producing localised downpours with rainfall rates of 25 to 40 mm per hour.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.

    <summary>At 04:37 pm, MetService weather radar detected severe thunderstorms near TE KARAKA, MATAWAI and OTOKO.

These severe thunderstorms are moving towards the northeast, and are expected to lie near TE KARAKA, WHATATUTU and KANAKANAIA at 05:07 pm and near WHATATUTU and KANAKANAIA at 05:37 pm.

These thunderstorms are expected to be accompanied by torrential rain, large hail and frequent lightning.

Impact:

Torrential rain can cause surface and/or flash flooding about streams, gullies and urban areas, and make driving conditions extremely hazardous.

Large hail can cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vines, glasshouses and vehicles, and make driving conditions hazardous.

Frequent lightning is dangerous to people and livestock, especially those exposed outdoors or on the water, and can cause power surges and damage to electrical equipment.</summary>
