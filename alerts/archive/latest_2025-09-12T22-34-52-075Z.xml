    <category term="Met" />
    <summary>A very fast moving front passes northwards through central and northern New Zealand late morning and during the afternoon, bringing a burst of heavy rain and strong winds, along with a moderate risk of squally thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 110 km/h.

Additionally, there is a moderate risk that these thunderstorms could become severe, generating wind gusts in excess of 110 km/h. Wind gusts of this strength can cause some structural damage, including trees and power lines, and may make driving hazardous. 

Thunderstorms have eased in Grey and Buller Districts and the Watch has been lifted for these areas.

Stay up to date with forecasts in case changes are made.
