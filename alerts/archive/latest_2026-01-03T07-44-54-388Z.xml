    <summary>Thunderstorms are occurring over western parts of Bay of Plenty and southern Waikato are expected to drift northwards during the evening, and some of these thunderstorms may become SEVERE bringing localised downpours with intensities of 25 to 40 mm per hour.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
