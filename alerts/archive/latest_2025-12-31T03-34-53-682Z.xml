    <summary>Conditions are favourable for development of heavy showers and thunderstorms this afternoon and evening. Some of these thunderstorms may become SEVERE, producing downpours of 25 to 40 mm/h. Thunderstorms are expected to ease tonight. Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
