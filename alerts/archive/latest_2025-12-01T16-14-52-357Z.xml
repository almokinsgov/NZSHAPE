    <summary>A period of rain and thunderstorms is possible about Northland overnight. 
If the thunderstorms occur, some of the storms may severe between about midnight Monday and 7am Tuesday with localised downpours of 25-40 mm/h. 
The most likely areas to be affected are northern and eastern parts of Northland north of Whangarei.
Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
