    <summary>A moist unstable northwesterly flow is expected to bring frequent showers and possible thunderstorms to Gisborne/Tairawhiti and the Wairoa District during this morning. There is a moderate risk of Severe Thunderstorms with downpours bringing localised rainfall rates of 25 to 40 mm/h.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips.
