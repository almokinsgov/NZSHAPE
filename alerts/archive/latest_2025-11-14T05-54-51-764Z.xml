    <summary>Scattered heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely this afternoon and early evening. Some of these thunderstorms may become SEVERE, producing localised downpours of 25 to 40 mm/h or large hail with diameter in excess of 2cm. Expect thunderstorm activity to ease tonight. Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. Large hail can cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vines, glasshouses and vehicles, as well as make driving conditions hazardous.
