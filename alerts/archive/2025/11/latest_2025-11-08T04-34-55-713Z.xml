    <summary>A warm moist air-mass and daytime heating are likely to generate heavy showers over Auckland and Northland today. For inland and western Northland, and Auckland about the Kaipara Harbour there is a moderate risk of SEVERE thunderstorms with downpours, 24 to 40 mm/h. These storms are capable of producing marble sized hail and flooding rainfall. 

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
