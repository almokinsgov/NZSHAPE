    <summary>A warm moist air-mass and daytime heating are likely to generate heavy showers and thunderstorms over inland parts the upper North Island this afternoon and evening. For inland parts of Northland, Auckland, the far south of Coromandel Peninsula, the far west of the Bay of Plenty and the northwest corner of Waikato. there is a moderate risk of SEVERE thunderstorms with localised downpours of 25 to 40 mm/h between 3 and 9pm today. Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
