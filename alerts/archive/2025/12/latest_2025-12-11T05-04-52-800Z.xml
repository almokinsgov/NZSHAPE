    <summary>Scattered thunderstorms are expected about parts of Canterbury, Otago and inland Southland today.
For parts of Canterbury south of the Rangitata River, North Otago, Dunedin and northern Clutha, a few of these thunderstorms may be severe between 4pm and 10pm today (Thursday) with localised downpours of 25-40mm and large hail in excess of 20mm diameter. One or two small tornadoes are also possible.
Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips.
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
Large hail can cause significant damage to crops, orchards, vines, glass-houses and vehicles, as well as make driving conditions hazardous.
If any small tornadoes do occur, they will be short-lived and very localised.
The thunderstorm activity dies away tonight.</summary>
