    <summary>A complex trough embedded in a moist unstable air-mass is expected to move east across the upper North Island today. For the eastern Bay of Plenty and the far north of Gisborne there is a moderate risk of thunderstorms with heavy rain associated with the trough this evening and at night. There is also a moderate risk of Severe thunderstorms with downpours bringing hourly rainfall amounts of 25 to 40 mm.

Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. 
Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.
